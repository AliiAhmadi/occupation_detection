This project is a basic machine learning pipeline for detecting a person's job category based on their resume text. It uses classical machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines to classify resumes into predefined categories such as IT, HR, Advocate, and more. The dataset used is from Kaggle and contains raw resume texts labeled by occupation. The text data is cleaned, transformed using TF-IDF vectorization, and passed into different models for training and evaluation. This project is ideal for learning how to apply traditional NLP techniques to real-world classification problems without deep learning.
